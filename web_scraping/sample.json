        "Paradox of Tragedy": [
            "David Hume famously remarked on a curious response we have to certain\nworks of art that cause us to feel unhappiness or distress:",
            "It seems an unaccountable pleasure, which the spectators of a\nwell-written tragedy receive from sorrow, terror, anxiety, and other\npassions, that are in themselves disagreeable and uneasy. The more\nthey are touched and affected, the more are they delighted with the\nspectacle; and as soon as the uneasy passions cease to operate, the\npiece is at an end. (1757 [1987: 216])",
            "This odd connection between the simultaneous pleasure and distress\ncaused by tragic drama is remarked upon in Aristotle’s\nPoetics, the earliest philosophical attempt in the West to\nconstruct an aesthetic theory. The problem also features in later\nthinkers such as Burke (1757), Kant (1798; 7:241 [1996: 232]), Batteux\n(1746 [2015: 48]), Schopenhauer (1818; 1844: ch. 37), and Nietzsche\n(1886: 229; Price, 1998), but the framing of the contemporary focus on\nthe problem is mainly inherited from Hume. After a preliminary attempt\nin\n Section 1\n to precisely state the paradox, we will turn to various kinds of\nsolutions in\n Sections 2 to 6."
        ],
        "1. Statement of the Paradox": [
            "At first glance, it shouldn’t be puzzling that works of art can\nelicit both pleasure and pain, for that conjunction arises in a wide\nrange of ordinary non-aesthetic contexts. Frozen fingers, e.g., often\ncome with playing in the snow. Hume’s enigma is that in certain\nartistic engagements our pleasure seems to be internally related to\nour distress. Pain is not merely a regrettable feature of the\nexperience, the elimination of which, insofar as the pleasure\nremained, would be favored (Neill 1992: 153). Rather, for Hume, one\nwould not derive certain characteristic pleasures from tragic dramas\nif they did not provoke their characteristic kinds of negative\nemotions qua negative emotions. It is the experience of\nnegative emotions, not something that happens to cause or be caused by\ntheir elicitation, that matters for our pleasure. As he notes,\naudiences are “pleased in proportion as they are\nafflicted” (1757 [1987: 217]). Although we will refer to this\nconundrum as the paradox of tragedy, the condition it\ndescribes is instantiated in many different modes of artistic\nexperience beyond the theater.",
            "Thus, on the one hand, we often pursue and take pleasure in works of\nart in ways that are ostensibly explained by their elicitation of\ndisagreeable feelings: fear of a movie’s monster, disgust over\nthe simulated viscera in a painting, shock in playing a video game,\ncringing embarrassment for a television comedy’s heedless\ncharacters, alienation through punk rock, grief in listening to a\nthrenody, disorientation entering into an installation, trauma in\nwitnessing certain modes of performance art, and even boredom or\nacedia that, for example, are intentionally elicited in Andy\nWarhol’s eight-hour continuous footage of the Empire State\nBuilding filmed from a static point of view (Gilmore 2020:\n157–158). On the other hand, such engagements do not conform to\nthe prima facie plausible assumption that we tend not to\npursue experiences for the distress, pain, annoyance, or other\naversive feelings they engender, and that when we must undergo such\nexperiences we do not positively value or take pleasure in those\ndisagreeable dimensions. Indeed, it might be proposed to be an\nanalytic truth that we don’t take pleasure in something in\nvirtue of what makes it displeasing to us.",
            "Before we consider alternative construals of the paradox, it is\nimportant to register that at least in Hume’s version the pains\nand pleasures of these kinds of artistic experiences aren’t\neasily accommodated in a pro tanto fashion. It seems right to\nsay that in an ordinary case such as playing in the snow, we take\npleasure in the experience insofar as it is diverting, an\nopportunity to be with friends, etc. and we feel discomfort in the\nexperience insofar as our fingers begin to freeze and we\nshiver. No paradox would arise in our experience of tragic drama from\nits eliciting painful and pleasurable emotions that, analogously, are\ndirected at respectively different objects (Ridley 2003). Some\ndescriptions of the phenomenon thus eliminate its paradoxical air by\nidentifying the distinct objects of pain and pleasure that have been\nunwittingly treated as one. By contrast, in Hume’s version of\nthe puzzle, we do not disvalue tragedy insofar as it causes us pain\nand value it insofar as it gives us pleasure. Rather, the pain or\ndistress a tragedy elicits seems itself positively valued\n(“unaccountably” so [1757: first line]). Further, that\npain and pleasure seem to directly covary: at least within a\nrestricted range, an increase in the former brings an increase in the\nlatter.",
            "Of course, mere covariance of pain and pleasure in some experience\ndoesn’t always pose a conundrum. Suppose that as it gets colder,\nthe quality of the snow in which children play improves. There, the\npleasure of throwing snowballs and the pain of frozen digits bear a\ndirect relationship, but only because they share a common condition or\ncause. Here, if the pain could be diminished without a loss in\npleasure, that would be something participants desire. By contrast,\nHume’s enigma is that we seem to want to suffer: we undergo some\nsort of positive emotion that is explained by our distress, not just\nby the circumstances by which the distress is caused. It is that\ndynamic that would make it odd to agree with the “Positive Opera\nCompany”, in an April Fools Day parody aired on National Public\nRadio, that audiences are better off when tragic operas such as\nDon Giovanni and La Bohème are rewritten to\nprovide happy endings (broadcast 1 April 2006). Or, in a genuine\nexample, it would be a dubious claim that audiences have reason to\nprefer Nahum Tate’s 1681 version of King Lear over\nShakespeare’s insofar as the revision eliminates the destruction\nof Lear and Cordelia that makes the original so distressing.",
            "As we will see, the cases we wish to understand are highly variable:\nthey, and the responses they elicit, may not fall into any natural\nclass (Neill 1999: 124). Furthermore, one may wish to abjure\nreferences to pain and other constitutively embodied\nresponses in contexts in which the distress is primarily constituted\nby psychological not somatic states (for a common concept of pain, see\nRaja et al. 2020). And to say that we suffer from a voluntary\ndiversion such as attending the theater or streaming a film on tv can\nsound rather grandiose, at least when compared to real suffering\npeople undergo in relation to non-imagined states of affairs. Allowing\nfor those cavils, we can offer at least a preliminary attempt at a\ngeneral characterization of the paradox, by saying that an experience\nhas a negative affective valence in part or whole if it is\none in which we feel pain or some other disagreeable emotion or\nfeeling. And an experience has a positive affective valence if it is\none in part or whole in which we feel pleasure or some agreeable\nemotion or feeling. The paradox can thus be stated as the conjunction\nof three individually plausible but jointly inconsistent\npropositions.",
            "For some instance or form of art A:",
            "Although conditions 1–3 capture the structure of the puzzle, we\nshould note that in the gloss on the paradox earlier, it was natural\nto refer to different kinds of attitudes being implicated beyond that\nof taking pleasure, viz, desiring and valuing. This\nreflects that there may be different formulations of the paradox\nemploying reference to different attitudes—affective, conative,\nevaluative—which are taken to be central and in need of\nexplanation.",
            "Thus, the Appreciation Condition may be that a proper appreciation of\nA elicits",
            "And the Response Condition may be that a proper appreciation of\nA furnishes",
            "Different formulations of the paradox may mix and match those\ndifferent kinds of attitudes (e.g., pairing the unpleasantness of the\nexperience with the desire that it occur). Yet, not all such\nconjunctions necessarily evince a puzzling conflict. In other words,\nnot all such pairings lend themselves to a plausible statement of the\nCoordination Condition. For example, as those with substance\naddictions would avow, to desire does not entail to\npositively appraise, and so a worrying over whether there is a\nconsistency between those attitudes of those different kinds,\nwhen expressed about any particular thing, can sometimes be\notiose.",
            "Even when we restrict the operative attitude to one kind (whether\nemotions, desires, or appraisals) two such attitudes toward the same\nobject can coherently disagree, as we saw above, in virtue of being\npro tanto, or directed at the object from a different\nperspective. Taking pleasure in one’s child leaving for college\nisn’t inconsistent with feeling sadness over her departure from\nhome. Mixed emotions and incompatible desires are a common feature of\naffective experience (Greenspan 1980; Larsen & McGraw 2014). Note,\nhowever, it would be too quick to assume any pairing of attitudes that\nbelong to different kinds is thereby rationally benign; for that would\nprejudge the question of whether a given attitude-kind imposes\nrational or psychological constraints on another. Some philosophers\nargue, for example, that a desire for x presents x\nas valuable or “good” (e.g., Stampe 1987). Some\npsychological theories of the emotions construe at least some of them\nas expressions of desires (Green 1992; Gordon 1987). And, finally,\nemotions themselves have characteristic somatic, cognitive,\nexpressive, behavioral, and phenomenological dimensions that can make\nparticular emotional pairings psychologically and physically difficult\nto sustain (Cowen & Keltner 2017).",
            "Furthermore, the statements of the paradox carry an implicit\nassumption that negative and positive valences exist on a single\ncontinuum, such that the more positively valenced an\nexperience is, the less negatively valenced it must be. But\nthere are empirical reasons to suspect that this relation does not\nhold, at least in the case of the valence of pleasure. Rather, some\nwork in the psychology of affective experience suggests that the two\nmeasures are orthogonal to one another (Norris et al. 2010). If this\nis so, it would render the co-presence of the two responses less\ncurious. But it would then raise the question of why, if Hume is\nright, the two independent responses seem to covary (assuming there is\nno common cause)—“The more they are touched and affected,\nthe more are they delighted with the spectacle” (1757 [1987:\n216]).",
            "Finally, a distinction elided in the above pairings is that between\nconstruing the paradox in descriptive and normative terms.\nDescriptively, the problem rests on the assumption that as an\nempirical matter we usually do not take pleasure in pain, but\nwith tragic art forms we do. Normatively, the problem rests on the\nassumption that we ought not to take pleasure in pain, but\nwith some of the arts, a successful appreciation means we should. As\nwe will see, the descriptive construal is threatened by the wide\nvariety of contexts in which indeed we do seem to take pleasure in\npain. Meanwhile, the normative construal is threatened by the\ndifficulty in providing a convincing interpretation of that\n“ought”. Is pursuing painful experiences or garnering\npleasure from pain practically irrational; a failure of fit or aptness\nof our emotions for their objects (i.e., where the formal object of\npleasure isn’t something that causes pain); defective with\nrespect to the evolved function of pain (as a signal of current or\nimmanent injury and elicitor of avoidance behavior); a misconstrual of\nthe objective value of the relevant artistic experiences; or perhaps\nin some other way unmerited or dysfunctional? Augustine calls that\npleasure in grief that we experience while watching tragic drama a\n“wretched madness” (Confessions Book 3, chapter\nII) but why it is irrational or “mad” to have that\nexperience is not explained.",
            "In what follows, we will focus on the paradox of tragedy construed\nsolely in descriptive terms, and, for economy’s sake, confine\nour attention to solutions that see the paradox in Hume’s terms,\nas, at least prima facie, involving a puzzling mixture of\npainful and pleasurable emotions. For a version of the paradox\nconstrued solely in terms of desires, see Currie (2010). The following\ndraws partly from the typology of solutions outlined in Levinson\n(2014b: xii)."
        ],
        "2. Compensatory Solutions": [
            "One major approach to the paradox introduces reasons for why, despite\nwhat appears to be our usual disposition to avoid pain and distress,\nwe may be rationally motivated to pursue experiences of art that\nelicit disagreeable feelings. Such compensatory approaches\nthus acknowledge the negative valence and undesirability of the\nfeelings we have while experiencing tragedies (and relevantly similar\nart forms), but contend that we choose to undergo those feelings for\nthe sake of realizing some sufficiently valuable good. Here, the\ndisagreeable dimension of an artistic experience is not positively\nestimated qua disagreeable dimension, but only for its contribution to\nsome specifiable benefit. Compensatory solutions might initially seem\nto dissolve even the appearance of a paradox, as it is hardly\nsurprising to note that pain is sometimes the price we pay for\npleasure. Yet, we don’t speak of, e.g., the “paradox of\ndentistry”. How is tragedy, and other painful art, different?\nCompensatory solutions tend to answer through highlighting ways in\nwhich the benefits of such art forms are in principle not realizable\nindependently of our undergoing their characteristic modes of causing\ndistress."
        ],
        "2.1 Hedonic Compensation": [
            "One such benefit that could render the experience of disagreeable\ndimensions of an art form worthwhile is aesthetic pleasure. Thus a\ncommon approach, motivated by Hume’s essay, is that we suffer in\nresponse to the content of the tragic representation but feel\npleasure in response to its formal features (Yanal 1991: 76;\nEaton 1989). The thought behind such hedonic compensatory\ntheories is that I feel pain in imaginatively representing the\ncontents of a play, but pleasure in such things as the play’s\nplot, language, scenery, costuming, and the actors’\nperformances. That pleasure is provided in a sufficient quantity or\ndegree to justify undergoing that pain. This solution thus treats the\nproper appreciation of a work of art as comprised of two distinct\naffective experiences, each with its own object: the represented\ncontent, and the medium or mode of representation. Our experience of\nthat content—e.g., through imagining that the represented state\nof affairs is real—is posited to cause us pain. At the same\ntime, our experience of the work’s medium or mode of\nrepresentation—e.g., through seeing its beauty or evaluating its\nplot—is said to give us pleasure. Thus, noting the pleasure\nelicited by a painter’s achievement of verisimilitude, Aristotle\nremarks that “objects which in themselves we view with pain, we\ndelight to contemplate when reproduced with minute fidelity”\n(Poetics IV). Although intuitively compelling, the problem with this\napproach is that it is exceedingly difficult to speak of our\nexperience of form or content as separable from the other in a way\nthat is consistent with artistic appreciation.",
            "Let us take a literary fiction as an illustration. In principle we can\nrefer solely to aspects of its content—what is fictionally true\nin the work, or how it represents the world as being. And, in\nprinciple, we can refer solely to aspects of its form—calling\nattention to its tone, verbal style, names of characters, plot\nstructure, and so on. However, even a minimal experience of the\nwork’s content will be inflected by the work’s form. This\nis so because the contents of a literary fiction are in part\nconstituted by how they are represented. Thus, for example,\nPeter Lamarque (2007: 121; 2014) notes that the features of\nshallowness and ostentation that Dickens invokes in the name of the\nVeneerings in Our Mutual Friend, are intrinsic qualities of\nthose characters themselves. Here, one’s experience of the\nwork’s content (the fictional characters) is inflected by the\nwork’s form (their names and the tone in which they are\ndescribed). Of course, the text of, specifically, a tragic drama\nexists prior to the play being performed. However, even there we can\nspeak of the represented content of the performance as inflected by\nits form, as we compare, e.g., one actor’s Hamlet to another, or\nthe staging of the play in traditional dress versus contemporary\nclothes. The mistake is to assume that form and content refer to two\ndistinct experiences of the object of our appreciation. But\nthere is only one experience of the work of art: the experience of the\ncontent-given-form.",
            "A proponent of the view in question might then respond that what\ncauses our pleasure is not merely the form of tragedy but its\ncontent-as-represented. We don’t take pleasure in the mere\ncontent: e.g., that Lear holds the murdered Cordelia, we take pleasure\nin the particular way in which the play (actors, staging, etc.)\nrepresents that event. But if such content-given-form is supposed to\nexplain our pleasure, then what explains our distress? It cannot be\nthe content itself, because we have no access to content, except as it\nis inflected by a given form. Similar problems beset attempts to treat\nthe different objects of our pain and pleasure as, respectively, the\nsad content of tragedy and its artistry, for any full\ndescription of the artistry of a work would require reference to what\nthat content is—what events and states of affairs are\nrepresented by the work. At best, one could say that certain formal\nfeatures of a tragedy offer pleasure in themselves, independent of\ntheir role in being constituents of the manner by which the\ntragedy’s content is represented. Aspects of lighting, costume,\nstage sets, music, movement, voice, etc., might be pleasurable in\nthemselves, perhaps thereby compensating for displeasure caused by a\nplot. Yet, this approach leaves open the following question: why do\naudiences often prefer to attend tragic dramas over alternative\ntheatrical productions with none of the tragedy’s\ndistress-inducing contents? Comedies are not always chosen over\ntragedies even if they offer the same formal rewards. We’ll\nreturn to that question below, after considering some other versions\nof and objections to the compensatory pleasures account.",
            "Note, it is an independent question whether the distinction between\nform and content as the respective targets of our feelings might\nexplain the puzzle of why people seem to take pleasure in the\nnon-fictional contents of a representation of awful events,\nfor there the events are not constituted by how they are represented.\nSometimes the distress caused by thinking of the events under one\ndescription can be counterposed against the pleasure caused by\nthinking of them under another description, where different framings\nimpose different patterns of saliencies on the shared content. One\nmight take pleasure in a historical account of a medieval method of\ntorture that highlights its bizarre and outlandish brutality but be\ndiscomfited by an account that makes vivid the excruciating suffering\nof its victim. By contrast, tragic dramas typically don’t\nlicense alternative points of view from which, respectively, their\ncontents elicit pleasure and distress.",
            "Some critics of compensatory theories centered on pleasure dispute the\nphenomenology such theories impute to the experience of painful art.\nSpecifically, they dispute the very claim that people feel pleasure in\nexperiencing such works. Rather, they note, people often describe\ntheir engagements with tragic dramas and the like as, “on the\nwhole, painful, distressing, gut-wrenching, and emotionally\ndevastating, not as on balance pleasurable” (Smuts 2014: 124;\nsee also Andrade & Cohen 2007).",
            "In response, a defender of a hedonic compensatory view might propose\nthat such reports should not be taken at face value. For a natural\nresponse to believing or perceiving a tragic event has occurred would\nbe to feel sympathy for its victim; for their suffering to linger on\nin one’s mind; to recall the event with sadness. But such\nreactions do not typically accompany merely imagining that such an\nevent occurred. If our putative expressions of pity for a fictional\ncharacter don’t have the behavioral profile of feeling pity for\nactual people, perhaps we don’t suffer for them the way we think\nwe do."
        ],
        "2.2 Hedonic Meta-Response": [
            "The hedonic meta-response theory offers a different critique\nof hedonic compensatory theories: that their defect is not in their\nappeal to pleasure per se, but where they locate it in our\nengagements with distressing works. The claim here is that we\ndon’t feel pleasure in the first-order experience of a tragic or\ndistressing work, but rather feel that pleasure as part of a\nsecond-order to that first-order response. Here, pain is necessary for\npleasure because the pleasure is given in a meta-response to the pain.\nThus, Rafael De Clercq (2014), for example, notes the pleasure we may\ntake in recognizing that a work is such as to evoke, or has\nevoked, a negatively-valenced emotion, even if we don’t take\npleasure in experiencing that emotion. For empirical studies\nsupporting that relation between first-order experience of aversive\nexperience, and pleasure in one’s meta-cognitive response to the\nexperience, see Rozin and others (2013).",
            "Why might audiences feel pleasure as part of such a meta-response? One\nproposal is that the experience makes salient one’s humanity;\nthat one shares with all others a susceptibility to feelings of\nsadness, loneliness, fear, and the like (Levinson 1982; Feagin 1983).\nAnother is that we may take pleasure in recognizing the work’s\nachievement in having elicited those emotions in us. A third is that\nour pleasure comes from having an opportunity to explore the nature of\nour suffering, without the motivation to alleviate it given that it\nisn’t a genuine indication of the bad things that typically\naccompany suffering in real life",
            "it becomes possible for us to savor the feeling for its special\ncharacter, since we are for once spared the additional distress that\naccompanies its occurrence in the context of life. (Levinson 1982:\n325)",
            "A fourth proposal, advanced by Susan Feagin is that our pleasurable\nmeta-response consists in recognizing our virtue. Specifically, we\nhave a first-order painful response arising from our sympathy with or\npity for the victims of a tragic drama, and second-order response, in\nwhich we take pleasure in recognizing how we felt in that first-order\nresponse. Feagin writes,",
            "We find ourselves to be the kind of people who respond negatively to\nvillainy, treachery, and injustice. This discovery, or reminder, is\nsomething which, quite justly, yields satisfaction. (1983: 98)",
            "One worry about such accounts of pleasure that locate it in a\nself-reflexive meta-response is that they seem to call into question\nthe genuineness of our concern for others that is part of the\nfirst-order response. Because of its self-reflexivity, the pleasure we\ntake in having that concern seems to stem not from being the\nkind of person who, e.g., feels pity and sympathy toward others, but\nfrom thinking of oneself as virtuous in that way. Indeed,\nchoosing to attend a tragic drama for the sake of that pleasure casts\ndoubt on the sincerity of one’s pity or sympathy for tragic\ncharacters—for pity and sympathy are not emotions one chooses to\nexperience for the sake of some personal end. In his\nLettre à d’Alembert, Rousseau proposes that, far\nfrom nurturing in us a genuine capacity for sympathy outside aesthetic\ncontexts, the best tragedies only function to",
            "reduce all the duties of man to some passing and sterile emotions that\nhave no consequences, [except] to make us applaud … our\nhumanity in pitying the ills that we could have cured. (1758 [1960:\n25])",
            "An alternative objection is that there are likely many people who lack\nmoral goodness but who respond with pity and sympathy to the fates of\ntragic characters. Perhaps their experience shows that we would be\nwrong to infer from our feeling pleasure in recognizing our pity for\ncharacters in a drama, to how we would feel for those in comparable\nstates of affairs in real life. In other words, while our\nmeta-response to our feelings for fictions might give us pleasure, we\nwould be unjustified in characterizing that meta-response as a\nrecognition of a genuine capacity for pity. Augustine disputes a\nsimilar claim that our pleasure in tragedy derives from the feeling of\ncompassion we have for its protagonists. Such mercy would imply a\ndesire that the sorrows of characters be eliminated, yet, as he notes,\nspectators desire that they be continued—taking pleasure in\none’s own sadness, one “sheds tears of joy”\n(Confessions Book 6).",
            "Another challenge, which we’ll look at more closely below in the\ndiscussion of the distancing approach, arises from a general\nrelation that theorists of fiction have proposed between the\nabsorption one experiences in engaging with a fiction and the degree\nto which one experiences self-awareness or self-conscious attention to\none’s experience. The proposal is that the relation is indirect:\nthe more one is self-conscious, the less one is absorbed, or\n“transported” into a fiction, and the less one experiences\ntypical effects of fictions such as emotional engagement. The problem\nthis raises for the meta-response theory is that a meta-response\ncalls for such self-consciousness—hence for a\ndiminution in the absorption that is typically a precondition of\nfiction-directed emotions. So the solution would seem to propose that\nthe very experience that gives us pleasure results in a weakening of\nthat pleasure’s causal condition.",
            "Some plausible responses would be that our meta-response and\nabsorption are not constant but alternate, i.e., we flip back and\nforth from attention to the contents of the story as if they were real\nto our own response to the story in which it is explicitly\nacknowledged as fictional. An alternative suggestion is that\nabsorption dominates the experience of the work but the pleasure in\nmeta-response to that experience takes hold once our engagement with\nthe story has concluded (e.g., when the play ends). The plausibility\nof these solutions can be addressed in part by how well they\ncharacterize the phenomenology of our experience of works such as\ntragedies. The verdict here is unclear.",
            "In any case, it shouldn’t be disputed that sometimes we feel\npleasure in virtue of a second order response to a first order\nresponse. One might laugh over the excessive fear one felt during a\nroller coaster ride, or one’s nervousness before a big date.\nAnalogous relations can hold as one reflects on one’s weeping\nduring a sad film, as one finds it curious how susceptible one is to\nhaving emotions triggered by what one knows to be fictional, or how\nautomatic tendencies to feel and behave certain ways expose the faults\nin one’s dignified image of oneself as having top-down cognitive\ncontrol over such reactions.",
            "Other candidates for the hedonic return in enduring tragedy’s\ncharacteristic forms of distress include the pleasure of relief, once\nthe unfolding of the story that sustains the distress has reached an\nend, and the pleasure of one’s sense of one’s comparative\nwellbeing in not being subject to the misfortunes of an aversive\nfiction’s protagonists (Lear 1988). Lucretius identifies the\ngeneral dynamic:",
            "’tis sweet\n\nTo mark what evils we ourselves be spared;\n\n’Tis sweet, again, to view the mighty strife\n\nOf armies battled yonder o’er the plains,\n\nOurselves no sharers in the peril. (De rerum natura Book II,\n5– 9).",
            "See Dadlez (2004: 222) for the potentially broad scope of Hume’s\nreference to pleasure, where it is associated with a wide variety of\ndistinct kinds of passions, including relief and hope."

        "2.3 Non-Hedonic Compensation": [
            "Approaches that reject the exclusively hedonistic flavor of\ncompensatory theories note that some of the goods afforded by aversive\nworks of art can be sufficiently compensatory without being\npleasurable. More precisely, such theories allow that tragedy can\ncause us to feel pleasure, but that is through offering us a distinct\nkind of good, the possession of which is itself valuable, and not just\nas a source of pleasure or satisfaction. Such theorists deny\nthe assumption of the response condition. Thus, Aaron Ridley\nremarks,",
            "There is … no reason at all to imagine that the value and\nimportance of tragic drama must ultimately derive from its capacity to\nplease. And that, surely, is just as well, since successful tragic\ndrama—think of Lear, think of Oedipus—is simply not all\nthat pleasing. (2003: 413; see also Budd 1995)"
        ],
        "2.3.1 Heightened Experience": [
            "One candidate for a value distinct from pleasure is mere affective\nstimulation. The thought here is that is we sometimes value\nexperiences that provoke us to strong feelings, extreme affective\nstates that may be valuable just because they are unusual in ordinary\nhumdrum life (which of course does not presume that any affective\nstate that is unusual is for that reason valuable).",
            "Hume (1757) considers L’Abbe Dubos’s argument for that\nproposal that it is the mere desire for heightened experience, whether\npositive or negative, that motivates us to be audiences for tragic\ndrama:",
            "No matter what the passion is: Let it be disagreeable, afflicting,\nmelancholy, disordered; it is still better than that insipid languor,\nwhich arises from perfect tranquility and repose. (1757 [1987:\n217])",
            "His objection, however, is that, as we saw earlier, our positive\naffect in engaging with a tragic drama is a result of exposure to its\nevents-as-represented, not to the events themselves:",
            "It is certain, that the same object of distress, which pleases in a\ntragedy, were it really set before us, would give the most unfeigned\nuneasiness; though it be then the most effectual cure to languor and\nindolence. (1757 [1987: 218])",
            "A related proposal is that what we take pleasure in is not the extreme\nstate of fear, sadness, disgust, and so on, but an aspect of those\nstates that is not intrinsically unpleasant (Morreal 1985). Thus some\nkinds of fear involve a feeling of excitement, and we may take\npleasure in that aspect of, e.g., riding a rollercoaster, without\nbeing said to take pleasure in all aspects of the fear that event may\ncause, such as a feeling of tightness in one’s chest.",
            "Smuts (2007) argues for what he calls the rich experience\ntheory which holds that audiences desire such works in part for the\nintrinsic value of the experiences they offer. These are experiences\none cannot typically undergo in ordinary life without paying serious\npsychic or physical costs. By “rich experience” Smuts\nmeans experiences that are “cognitively, sensorily, and\naffectively engaging” (2014: 132). Here, the painful experience\nis not, alone, valuable, so much as it is partly constitutive\nof experiences that are valuable."

        "2.3.2 Cognitive Value": [
            "Other goods relate to the cognitive benefits, broadly understood, of\nthe experience of tragic drama. Thus, it has been proposed (most\nfamously in association with the obscure notion of\n“catharsis”) that tragedies offer spectators an\nopportunity to clarify their emotions. On interpretations of\nAristotle’s notion of catharsis, see Nehamas (1994); on the\nambiguity of the concept, see K. Bennett (1981) and Lear (1988). The\nproper understanding and existence of catharsis is controversial\n(Shelley 2003). But a plausible construction of the idea is that we\ncome to learn about some of our emotions when their expression is\nelicited by highly affecting works of art, in the case of tragedies\nspecifically by the “release” of the negative emotions of\nfear and pity that comes with the narrative resolution of the plot.\nThere, the expression of our emotions does not leave them unchanged;\nrather, they are exposed, fine-tuned, and given a salient form when\narising in conformity to a work of tragedy’s prescriptions for\nhow to feel. For the view that emotions can be brought into\nperspicuity through their expression, see Collingwood (1938:\n109–11) and Gilmore (2011). Another cognitive benefit is an\nintrinsically valuable enlightenment about the nature of suffering.\nFlint Schier (1989) thus discusses how an artistic representation may\nallow us a more objective understanding of such things as distress and\npain, and more broadly, the nature of our and other’s human\npredicament, than would our witnessing actual distress. For example,\nin the case of an actual event, our concern for our own safety might\nobscure our understanding of the depth and character of the suffering\nof others. Schier argues that we desire such knowledge because it is\nintrinsically valuable, and thus take pleasure in acquiring it (see\nalso Shelley 2003). Relatedly, Kames proposes that tragedy helps to\nenhances our sympathy and (thereby) strengthens our virtues (1751:\nEssay i, 49–50). Hutcheson, by contrast, notes the satisfaction\nwe take in morally approving the virtuous dispositions of characters\nin a tragedy in response to the struggles they face (1725: ii, 6.7,\n240–241).",
            "A third non-hedonic value is an opportunity afforded by tragic works\nof art to contemplate and better come to understand our own\nvulnerability to loss. Referring to the last point in his discussion\nof Shakespeare’s tragedies, Samuel Johnson writes that",
            "the reflection that strikes the heart is not, that the evils before us\nare real evils, but that they are evils to which we ourselves may be\nexposed. (1765: 77–78)",
            "Other cognitive approaches suggest that the benefits offered by\npainful emotions pertain to understanding the work of art itself.\nThus, Goodman (1968 [1976: 248–52]), treats both negative and\npositive emotions as potential modes of sensitivity to a\nwork—helping discern properties of it that a colder\ndispassionate appraisal would miss. Maybe there is a point conveyed by\na work to which we remain uncomprehending unless sufficiently attuned\nto it via the focus on it engendered by being in a particular\nemotional state.",
            "Relatedly, Korsmeyer (2011) endorses what she identifies as a\n“conversionary account” (see\n Section 5\n below). In her view, the disgust and fear we feel for some\nrepresentations are not transformed into different, pleasurable\nemotions, but rather serve (are “put to use”) in the\nattainment of aesthetically or otherwise valuable responses to that\nrepresentation (2011: 132). For example, disgust and fear elicited by\na representation can heighten attentive absorption (2011:\n132) in that thing. And “death”, she writes, “is\nrealized differently in the experience of disgust” (2011: 134),\nsuggesting that there is epistemic value peculiar to an experience\nthat is realized through its elicitation of disfavored feelings.\nRather than demonstrating a conversion of negative feelings, this\naccount is better characterized as identifying a compensation that\nthey lead to, viz, the achievement of such things as attentive\nabsorption for which we undergo fear and disgust; or the realization\nof an overall pleasurable whole, of which the negative emotions are\nparts. See a related proposal in Todd (2014) that our awareness of a\nfiction qua fiction shapes the negative emotions that its\ncontents elicit, and those negative emotions in turn strengthen and\nfocus our attention to those contents.",
            "A final candidate for a quasi-cognitive good is the satisfaction of\ncuriosity or achievement of understanding. The thought here is the\nunderstanding gained in satisfying our curiosity is itself valuable\n(cognitively so) and is pleasing to obtain. Indeed, just as the\npleasure of slaking one’s thirst helps motivate the search for\nlife-sustaining hydration, the pleasure of achieving understanding is\npart of what helps motivate our efforts to realize and garner its\nintrinsic value. Aristotle notes in the Poetics that\n“we enjoy looking at the most exact portrayals of things whose\nactual sight is painful to us” (Poetics IV; he refers\nto pictures of corpses as an example) and explains this pleasure as\narising from the knowledge acquired in viewing such representations.\nSee the more contemporary account by Carroll on the role of disgust in\nhorror films (1990: 184–5) where our pleasure is not in the\ndisgust itself but in the disclosure of the unknown—the\nmonster—of which disgust is a predictable concomitant.",
            "One concern with the cognitive account is whether the putative\ncognitive benefits are sufficiently strong to compensate for the\ndispleasures of tragedy. If we learn something largely propositional\nfrom tragic or other disturbing works of art, it isn’t clear why\nwe tend to see them again and again. If learning such and such\nexplains why we endure the pain a tragedy causes, this wrongly\nsuggests that seeing the tragedy a second time somehow deprives it of\nits compensatory value—since we already know what it teaches.\nPerhaps a response is that we learn something more completely or\ndifferently with subsequent viewings. Although this criticism is drawn\nfrom generally applicable anti-cognitive approaches to the arts, it\ntakes on a special plausibility in the case of tragic drama which,\nunlike, e.g., novels, we often see in several iterations.",
            "Another objection addresses an ambiguity faced by cognitive accounts\nover whether the compensation tragedy offers is the value of\nunderstanding, or merely the value of having the feeling of\ngaining understanding. If, as some of the cognitive compensatory\napproaches note, it isn’t for the sake of the cognitive benefit,\nbut for the sake of the pleasures associated with those cognitive\nbenefits, that we submit ourselves to the unpleasant emotions of\ntragedy, how important is it that those cognitive benefits be\ngenuine?",
            "Jonathan Lear (1988) identifies, for example, one of the goods of\ntragedy as being the consolation it offers in explaining that\nwhen bad things happen to good people, those occurrences are\nintelligible and explicable: they do not “occur in a world which\nis in itself ultimately chaotic and meaningless” (1988: 325).\nYet, as Aristotle observes, what is important in a well-formed tragedy\nis that events appear plausible or credible, not that they\nactually are (Poetics XXIV). The appearance of\nexplaining this consoling fact takes precedence over actually\nimparting knowledge of how the world works, at least in\nAristotle’s estimation of what best generates artistic value.\nPerhaps what matters is not that we learn from tragedy, but that we\nhave the satisfying feeling of having learned. If that is true of the\nsupposed cognitive values found in tragedy then at least some versions\nof the cognitive theory collapse into the hedonistic theory. We value\nthe feeling of learning something occasioned by the experience of\nfictions; that we actually learn something is not necessary for that\nfeeling to arise. A natural counter to this reduction of cognitive to\nhedonistic accounts would be to note that while one may take as much\npleasure in merely seeming to learn as in actually learning from a\nwork of art, it is the pleasure of the latter experience that explains\nthe possibility of the pleasure of the former. Just as we find\npleasant the sweetness of artificial sweeteners only because we are\ndisposed to find pleasant the taste of actual sugar, so any cases of\ndelight we take in seeming to learn must be understood against a\nbroader background in which we take pleasure because we actually\nlearn."

        "2.3.3 Meaning and Function": [
            "A last kind of compensatory approach points to the ways in which\ncertain experiences are meaningful to us in part in virtue of\nthe pain or distress they involve, without any implication that such\npain or distress is otherwise intrinsically or instrumentally valuable\n(Bloom 2021).",
            "Why should the pain an experience causes accrue to its meaningfulness?\nMultiple explanations suggest themselves. From an evolutionary\nperspective, that a given achievement involves suffering may reveal it\nas a “costly signal” of the virtues or desires of the\nachiever. The distress an activity causes may serve to distinguish\nthose who really value or need it (and thus are willing to endure its\nassociated pain) from those for whom the activity is relatively\nunimportant, and thus something they’d pursue only at a low\ncost. For a discussion of how deliberate self-harm might serve as a\n“costly-signal” see Hagen, Watson, and Hammerstein (2008).\nFor discussion, see Bloom (2021: 64). These explanations tend to focus\non how the willingness to undergo pain redounds to the authenticity of\nan emotion or sincerity of an expressed desire for the experience in\nwhich the pain is elicited.",
            "Related explanations posit certain functions, of which one is\ntypically unaware, in the pursuit of negative emotions through art.\nMar and Oatley (2008), for example, describes fiction as having the\nfunction of social simulation. It is perhaps true that horror fiction\nappears to rely on the same mental architecture as actual experiences\nin producing its effects on our emotions and body. And perhaps\naversive fiction causes or enables an ability to learn from and deal\nwith genuine threats, losses, and other setbacks to our interests via\nsimulation, but that doesn’t explain why we take pleasure in it\nor pursue it. We would need to posit another explanatory factor here\nthat says that we desire (unconsciously?) to do things that further\nour capacities, e.g., of responding to things that make us suffer.\n“Function” here is used only in an evolutionary\nsense—i.e., in the sense in which the psychological disposition\nto have such experiences (pleasure from pain or fear) was acquired in\npart because it helped to produce beings like us. Alternative accounts\nfavor an explanation that appealed to exaptation. The appeal to\nevolution speaks only to the question of how our cognitive and\nemotional makeup makes such experiences possible, not why now, in the\npresent day, we ought to desire these experiences.",
            "An important point about most compensatory approaches is that,\nalthough drawing on Hume’s introduction of the problem, they\nconstrue the paradox in ways that depart from the Scottish\nphilosopher’s terms. Hume posits an internal relation between\nthe disagreeable and agreeable responses engendered by tragedy. The\npreceding compensatory approaches, by contrast, treat the negative\naspects of a work of art as merely a necessary cost to be entered into\nan overall accounting of the net value of experiencing a work of art.\nIn that approach, the negative dimension of a work is not valued as\nsuch; instead, it is valued only insofar as it plays a role in\nproducing the positive dimensions. If one could do away with the\nsadness a tragedy causes us to feel while preserving the enlightenment\nthe play affords, the value of the experience would be the same or\nincreased. Some solutions that appeal to the pleasures of tragedy\nexemplify this. Delight in spectacle does not require the spectacle\nbeing produced through rebarbative events.",
            "The exceptions are compensatory approaches (what Levinson [2014b: xii]\ncalls “organicist”) in which the connection between the\nnegative and positive dimensions of the experience is tighter and the\nlatter is directly dependent on the former (presumably only within\ncertain ranges). Earlier, we saw an objection to solutions to the\nparadox that say that, in a pro tanto manner, we take\npleasure in the formal or aesthetic dimensions of a tragedy and feel\npain about its content. The objection was that this implies that if we\ncould experience the formal aspects of tragedy in a work that caused\nus no pain, we would prefer that to the tragedy. While this is of\ncourse sometimes the case, it is implausible to posit it as a general\nrule. We do often choose tragedies over comedies, without assuming the\nlatter is deficient in its formal values. A rejoinder here is the\nproposal that the pain that tragic drama causes possesses a particular\ncharacter, making the experience of that pain a precondition\nfor realizing tragedy’s particular compensatory good. That good,\nin other words, cannot be furnished by a work without tragedy’s\ndistressing dimension. In one such proposal, for example, it is only\nin and through the suffering elicited by tragedy that we contemplate\nour vulnerability to loss. In another proposal certain aesthetic or\nexperiential values can be realized only in our encounters\nwith such works (Budd 1995). The suffering we experience in watching a\ntragedy might, for example, have cognitive value both in the familiar\nsense in that it allows us to learn about the suffering of others, or\nto enhance our capacity for empathy, and the more interesting sense in\nwhich certain insights may be available to us only through our\nsuffering. Sadness might, for example impose an otherwise inaccessible\npattern of saliency on what we see and on our relation to it.",
            "Of course, tragedy’s characteristic benefits may be multiple and\nthe theories cited above are not always mutually-exclusive in\ncharacterizing the good that comes with the bad. However, a more\nelaborate mapping of the logical space of such solutions would ask to\nwhat extent a given theory excludes another, either by making the\nlatter explanation otiose, or denying the description of the phenomena\nthe latter assumes to be true."

        "3. Contextual Solutions": [
            "Some explanations don’t so much identify the reasons for which\nwe desire to experience disagreeable art, as identify the conditions\nunder which we are able to have those experiences. Two such conditions\nare distance and control."
        ],
        "3.1 Distance": [
            "It’s often claimed of the artistic medium in which tragic\nstories are told that it allows us to experience their content in a\nsafely “distanced” form, one that prevents us from\nsuffering as we would if we were witness to an analogous state of\naffairs outside of that artistic context. As Edmund Burke (1757) notes\nin his remarks on the sublime,",
            "When danger or pain press too nearly, they are incapable of giving any\ndelight, and are simply terrible; but at certain distances, and with\ncertain modifications, they may be, and they are delightful, as we\nevery day experience. (part 1 section VII)",
            "In his essay on the Laocoon (1766), Gotthold Ephraim Lessing suggests\nthat beauty can have such a distancing effect when he argues that\nbecause artists understood it would have been too painful for\naudiences to confront a fully realistic representation of the\nsuffering involved in the story, they represented that story in a\nbeautiful form.",
            "Accounts of such distancing identify a condition, perhaps a necessary\none, under which an experience of tragic drama can be pleasurable, but\nnot why it is pleasurable. Answers to that latter question may appeal\nto a wide variety of considerations explaining why we enjoy a given\nart form, many of them listed in\n Section 2.1.",
            "That there is a metaphorical distance between audiences and what they\nare prompted to imagine by a fictional representation makes intuitive\nsense. One can’t intervene in a play’s state of affairs to\nchange its outcome; one can’t be physically harmed by the events\nthat a novel prompts us to visualize. And, even highly vivid\nfiction-directed imaginings don’t typically cause us to believe\nthat what we mentally represent is genuinely before us. In one kind of\naccount, emotions that are too raw, too overwhelming, or too powerful\nto endure when experienced unmediated, are better contained when\nexperienced via the psychological and practical “remove”\naudiences have toward fictional representations. See the discussion in\nRobinson (2005) on “Formal Devices as Coping Mechanisms”\nand the idea of a “protective frame” furnished by\nknowledge of a situation’s fictionality in Apter (1992). Without\nsuch distancing, powerful emotions can get in the way of the\nexperience of pleasure that audiences can take in features of the\nartistic representation. Likewise, such powerful emotions can prevent\nus from achieving the various forms of insight and understanding for\nwhich we value and pursue the experience of such works. In a\nrepresentative example of this approach, Menninghaus and his\ncollaborators (2017) draw on substantial empirical literature in\npsychology to argue that only via the activation of certain\ndistancing processes, such as one’s being made aware of\na film’s fictional status, can there arise certain\nembracing processes via which audiences experience pleasures\nderiving from such things as “an interplay between positive and\nnegative emotions”; one’s attention to a piece’s\nartistry; and the social dimensions of one’s sharing with others\nthe experience of the work. Distancing processes",
            "keep negative emotions at some psychological distance, thereby\nsafeguarding the hedonic expectations of art reception against being\ninevitably compromised by the experience of negative emotions. (2017:\n3)",
            "In other words, distancing prevents the negative emotions from getting\nin the way of the positive emotions that would otherwise emerge in\none’s experience of a work.",
            "Yet, despite its familiarity, there are conceptual problems with\nemploying the idea of distancing in a solution to the paradox of\ntragedy. These problems emerge when we try to unpack what is literally\nasserted when one says tragedies distance audiences from the horrible\nstates of affairs they represent. Let us suppose that what is meant by\ndistancing is a kind of moderation or subduing of an otherwise extreme\nemotional response. To say we are distanced by a factor such as\nfictionality is to say that we feel an emotion with less intensity\nthan we otherwise would if such fictionality were not present. We are\nthen able to avail ourselves of those pleasures and other benefits of\ntragedy whose emergence would be frustrated by emotions that are more\nextreme. One objection to such an account calls into question the very\npremise that audiences for tragic drama and the like are\ndistanced in that emotion-subduing way that the explanation proposes.\nFor, prima facie, audiences of tragic fictions do experience\npowerfully painful emotions, Having such affective experiences does\nnot impede their pleasure, but, if Hume is right, enhances it. An\ninverse of that objection is that, as Hume notes, under certain\nconditions we can take pleasure in non-fictional representations of\nawful things, even though confronting them directly would cause us\ndistress. There is no assumption of fictionality in Cicero’s\noratory of terrible events, yet in his eloquence, Hume writes,",
            "the uneasiness of the melancholy passions is not only overpowered and\neffaced by something stronger of an opposite kind; but the whole\nimpulse of those passions is converted into pleasure, and swells the\ndelight which the eloquence raises in us. (1757 [1987: 220])",
            "A more significant problem may be found in the claim that we can speak\nof the same emotion, whether it is experienced unmediated or\nin a manner that involves putative distancing. For to adopt a\ndistanced attitude toward someone for whom one feels anguished pity is\nnot to continue to feel anguished pity, just “at a\ndistance”. It is to feel something else altogether, or not to\nfeel at all. The distancing approach does not explain how we can\nendure feeling an emotion of the same kind and quality toward\na fictional state of affairs but not toward an analogous real state of\naffairs. It elides, instead, two categorically different\nemotions—one that is weak, short-lived, potentially\ndis-passionate, and one that is overwhelming or otherwise so powerful\nas to block any pleasures that the occasion might allow. Claiming that\nthe affective or phenomenological character of the emotion we feel for\na fiction is different from that which we feel for like affairs in\nreal life can suggest a solution to the paradox. Specifically, it\nwould be to reject the appreciation condition—the claim\nthat properly appreciating an artwork of the relevant kind causes one\nto feel serious distress. However, that solution comes at the\nconsiderable cost of denying the presence of the aversive feelings we\nexperience in watching painful art that makes the appreciation\ncondition plausible in the first place.",
            "An alternative objection to the distancing approach is that it\nimproperly locates the source of the putative ameliorative effect that\nfictionality has on our emotions. For, as noted earlier, many\nnon-fictional representations can elicit pleasure through, or along\nwith, causing distress. Even as their contents cause feelings of\ndistress, pity, and disgust, we sometimes enjoy reading of such things\nas historical narratives of violent battles, tabloid reports of\ngruesome deaths, and seeing beautiful or otherwise compelling\nphotographs of abject and suffering individuals, natural disasters,\ncities in ruins, and other subjects we would not take pleasure in\nseeing face-to-face. Perhaps the distancing model must dispense with\nthe distinction between fictions and nonfictions, and help itself\ninstead to a different distinction, such as that between\nrepresentational and confrontational contexts (Matravers 2014). Here,\nfictionality, as such, is not what explains our capacity to take\npleasure in painful experiences, rather being fictional is only one of\nmany ways in which a state of affairs can be something into which we\ncannot intervene and cannot be practically affected by.",
            "Finally, the distancing approach attributes a mental state to\naudiences that is at odds with the mental state briefly referred to in\n Section 2.2\n that at least prima facie appears to be a precondition of a\nfiction causing intense feelings: imaginative immersion. Sometimes\ncalled absorption or fictional transportation,\nimaginative immersion describes an engagement with the contents of a\nfictional representation typified by several dimensions: inter\nalia, selective and sustained attention; a fluency in access to\nand processing of information supplied by one’s attention;\ncognitive, affective, and behavioral responses that are experienced as\nendogenously elicited by the contents of the representation, rather\nthan by the representational vehicle itself; and, a diminished\nself-consciousness or meta-reflective attention to those responses\n(Gerrig 1993; Green & Brock 2002; Mazzocco et al. 2010).",
            "Plausibly, a fictional story can cause us to feel aversive emotions\nonly when we are absorbed in its content (as opposed to, say, immersed\nin the second order experience of performing a literary analysis). But\nif this is true, it is hard to see how the distancing approach can\nclaim both that we can experience such aversive emotions and be aware\nof ourselves as removed from the state of affairs represented by the\nfiction. The absorption condition says that only by audiences being\nimaginatively immersed in the state of affairs a tragedy represents\ncan it have its characteristic effects, while the distancing condition\nsays we experience the pain and pleasure of tragedy only when\nunderstanding ourselves as being at a good remove from that state of\naffairs. Hence, the distancing and immersion approaches represent\ncompeting pictures of our mental states during artistic\nengagements.",
            "Although different explanations of the paradox of tragedy may offer\ndistinct, yet complementary, causes for the phenomenon, we can see how\nthe distancing approach stands as a direct competitor to compensatory\nsolutions. Compensatory approaches like those in\n Section 2\n take the strength of the negatively valenced emotion aroused by a\ndisturbing work of art to require some positively-valenced emotion, or\nother valuable property for the whole experience of the work of art to\nbe sought after and valued. But if distancing eliminates or\nreduces the awfulness of some fiction state of affairs, no such\nor less such compensation is required to understand why the fiction as\na whole is desirable. To the extent that distancing has the effect its\nproponents say, the compensatory solutions become otiose."

        "3.2 Control": [
            "The second kind of condition under which it is proposed that tragedies\ncan be pleasurable is control. Because I know that I can stop\nor modify my experience of painful art, the pain is less severe, or\nacquires a different valence than it has in ordinary contexts.\nSpecifically, under such a condition one source of the badness of pain\nis eliminated: one’s not knowing that it can be controlled.\nControl in this sense is broader than and can include the dimension of\ndistancing described earlier: specifically, according to the control\ntheory, if one believes one cannot distance oneself from the\nphenomenon then one cannot take pleasure in it.",
            "Theorists who propose that a control condition operates in our\nexperience of tragic drama stress the greater degree of power we have\nover the pain caused by works of art than over the pain caused by\nordinary experience (see Eaton 1982; Morreall 1985). Specifically, we\ncan enjoy tragic and other sorts of aversive works of art when we are\naware we can direct our thoughts and actions vis-à-vis\nthe work in question. Theorists argue that such control limits or\nchanges the character of the putative painfulness of some works of\nart, such that the pain at issue doesn’t generate the paradox\nthat a desire for, or valuing of, ordinary pain would. One way such\ncontrol is manifested is in our awareness, when experiencing negative\naffect vis-à-vis art, that the story belongs to a\ngenre in which it is typical for all things to work out in the end.\nOne may also simply infer a happy ending from what one knows about a\nwork, as one’s sadness over the life-threatening illness of a\ntelevision character is made tolerable by one’s knowledge that a\nseries wouldn’t kill them off so soon. Feelings of anxiety or\nfear are therefore accommodated through modes of affective regulation\nthat rely on our familiarity with the artform in question.",
            "Solutions to the paradox based on control face two major objections.\nOne is that already lodged against distance theories: the control\ntheorist argues that the typical negative valence of a given emotion\nis ameliorated or eliminated when our experience of it is one over\nwhich we have some power. The problem here is assuming that thus\nseparated from its displeasing or aversive dimension via a sense of\ncontrol, the negative emotion is the same emotion it would otherwise\nbe. Theories of emotions that hold that the valence of an emotion is\nan intrinsic quality of it would disagree. For them, a solution to the\nparadox based on the control condition doesn’t explain how we\ncan take pleasure in a displeasing emotion, it just implicitly denies\nthat we experience the displeasing emotion in question. The second\nobjection is that the control condition seems false to experience: one\ncan feel fully in control over whether or not one attends to a\nhorrifying, disgusting, or tragic state of affairs in a fictional film\nwithout that sense of control making attending to those elements any\nless displeasing (Gaut 1993: 338). Attending to a fictional\nrepresentation of such events might be less distressing than actually\nwitnessing such events. However, it is not clear that whether control\nis given or withheld over attending to the fictional representation of\nawful circumstances makes a difference in the aversive feelings it\ncauses."
        ],
        "4. Conversionary Accounts": [
            "Some explanations of the paradox suggest that in our experience of\npainful art, the content is rendered in such a way so as to\n“convert” its distressing elements, as a kind of raw\nmaterial, into a pleasurable form. Hume’s account lends itself\nto this interpretation (Yanal 1991). It is not only, he writes, that\nthe “melancholy passions” are overcome by “something\nstronger of the opposite kind” but that those passions are\n“converted into pleasure” (1757 [1987: 220]). Here, Hume\nstresses that the negative emotions aroused by the distressing events\nmust be of a sufficiently high intensity for the accompanying or\nconsequent pleasure furnished by the conversion of those passions to\nbe as substantial as it is. So, for example, Cicero’s eloquence\napplied to ordinary events would not result in a pleasure with as\ngreat a magnitude as when it’s applied to awful ones.",
            "One explanation of the phenomenon Hume describes appeals to a\ndifference between an initial painful or distressing experience of a\nstimulus and the experience of that stimulus in light of one’s\nawareness that it poses no threat of injury or harm to one’s\nwell-being. In this connection, Paul Rozin coined the term\n“benign masochism” to refer to the enjoyment of\n“initially negative experiences that the body (brain) falsely\ninterprets as threatening”. This realization that the pain poses\nno real danger, Rozin and his colleagues write, “leads to\npleasure derived from ‘mind over body.’” (2013:\n 439).[1]\n Even assuming that the psychological description is correct, the\nphenomenon described may not exemplify a “conversion” of\nan emotion, but rather a replacement of one emotion with another, the\nlatter constituted by a different cognitive base, e.g., from a belief\nor perception to an imagining. On cognitive bases of emotions, see\nDeonna and Teroni (2008 [2012]) and Gilmore (2020: 45). Of course,\ndistinguishing here between conversion and replacement may be\nconstrued as only a verbal dispute.",
            "An alternative possibility for capturing the conversionary proposal\nwould be to appeal to the familiar idea that the form, manner, or\nmedium of a representation shapes our responses to its contents. To\nuse Hume’s example, death and destruction, the representation of\nwhich would normally provoke horror and pity, give us pleasure when\nrepresented in Cicero’s eloquent description. And the greater\nthe pity and horror those events would produce absent that eloquence,\nthe greater the pleasure they can elicit when conveyed via a\nrepresentation possessed of an eloquent form. That different modes of\nrepresenting an event may elicit, respectively, different kinds and\ndegrees of emotional responses is uncontroversial. But that\nexplanation of varied responses to different framings of the same\nevent doesn’t tell us how distressing emotions are\n“converted” into pleasurable ones. One reason is that, as\nwe saw earlier in compensatory theories that appeal to form\nas compensation for content, our responses to distressing\nworks of art are always to the content-as-represented, that is, the\ncontent in a given form, manner, style, etc. There are not, as it\nwere, two stages in our exposure to such events: one in which we feel\ndistress over what is described “independent” of their\nhaving been represented for us and a second in which that distress is\nchanged into pleasure. There is just our response to those\nevents-as-represented.",
            "It is a truism of artistic production that a given event that would\nprovoke pain or distress if it actually occurred can be rendered in a\nfictional form that will provoke other kinds of emotions, such as\nlaughter, or no emotion at all. Picaresque novels often subject their\nprotagonists to various forms of violent injury that would indeed be\npainful, if real, to behold, but are a source of humor when confined\nto a fiction. The animated series Southpark kills off the\nlittle boy Kenny in one episode after another, but to only comedic\neffect; and it should go without saying, the history of art is\npopulated by paintings and sculptures of murder, rape, and torture\nrendered in stylized and beautiful forms that evoke wonder and\ndelight, not the revulsion that the representation of actual such\nevents would cause. However, such cases illustrate not the conversion\nof emotions, but merely their elicitation. Furthermore, when we\nconfine our attention to fictional objects, there doesn’t even\nexist a contrasting case of the events framed in a different way. For,\nas noted in\n Section 2.1,\n there is no sense in which we have access to the contents of a\nfiction independent of their representation. The contents of a fiction\nare constituted by how they are represented. Those events may\nbe distressing or pleasurable to behold, but it is not the case that\nthe style, manner, form, etc. of how they are represented somehow\ntransforms what they are “prior” to that\nrepresentation.",
            "Even if we had a plausible description of how our emotions elicited by\ntragedy are converted from distress to pleasure, conversionary\naccounts face the challenge of showing that the relevant emotions are\ntransformed into forms in which they relinquish their negative\nvalence, while remaining the same emotion. As we saw in the\nobjection to distancing solutions to the paradox, it is highly\ncontroversial to assert that when a given emotion is shorn of its\nusual valence, it remains an instance of the same emotion-kind. There\nare many theories of emotions and no consensus over which has the best\nintensional, extensional, and explanatory account. However, it seems\nhighly intuitive that if a given emotion kind has any\nessential features, how the emotion feels (its phenomenology) is one\nof them. If, as conversionary accounts suggest, aesthetic contexts can\neffect a transformation in a given emotion to one with a valence not\nat all resembling that which it has in its usual manifestations, we\nmay have a case not of the conversion of a given emotion, but a\nreplacement of one kind of emotion with another. When we turn to\nRevisionary Solutions in\n Section 6\n we’ll see a solution to the paradox that explicitly tries to\nmeet that challenge by rejecting the intuition that the valence we\nassociate with a given instance of an emotion is one of its essential\nfeatures."

        "5. A Broader Approach to the Phenomenon": [
            "When the experience at issue is construed without restriction to\nfictions, many kinds of engagements outside of the artistic sphere\nfall within its scope. We often find satisfaction in nonfictions,\ne.g., in historical narratives, even as they generate pity or anger.\nMany people are titillated by disturbing pictures or reports in the\nnews. Enjoying Reality TV depends on its participants genuinely\nbehaving in ways that viewers find deplorable. Others find violent\nsports repellent but enthralling. A long-distance runner might find\nsatisfaction in exercising to the point of exhaustion, and not just\nfor the training stimulus it offers. And, for a thrill, one might eat\ntoo-spicy chili peppers, risk one’s physical well-being, or\nimagine inordinately nauseating or frightful circumstances. See Bloom\n(2021) for a compendium of such contexts in which people seem to take\npleasure in undergoing experiences that are prima facie\nunpleasant",
            "When construed in a descriptive fashion, the puzzle arising from our\nengagement with tragic works of art assumes that they call for a\nresponse that contrasts with that which we tend to exhibit in\na class of normal cases. However, the wider the range is of relevantly\nsimilar experiences such as those surveyed above, the more dubious is\nthe premise that initially gives rise to the puzzle: viz., our finding\nvalue in some experiences in virtue of the negative feelings they\nevoke is so unlike our other sorts of attitudes and behavior\nthat it requires some distinctive explanation. However, if it is true\nthat we have that response in many contexts outside of our engagement\nwith tragedy, then its paradoxical air is difficult to sustain. We\nmight still want to know what gives us pleasure in tragedy but there\nwould be no special paradox of tragedy calling for a solution\n(Gilmore 2020: 159–60). Indeed, we may contrast those sorts of\nsocially acceptable pursuits in which one takes satisfaction in\none’s distress with other sorts that do call for a\nspecial explanation, such as some practices of deliberate\nself-harm.",
            "Resisting this denial that there is a paradox calls for some\ndemonstration that the experience of pleasure through pain in art is\nsufficiently unlike that found in ordinary non-artistic contexts to\ndemand its own explanation. Two such approaches can be found in\nRevisionary solutions."
        ],
        "6. Revisionary Solutions": [
            "Revisionary approaches to the paradox of tragedy attack the premise\nthat seems most immune to being falsified, the appreciation\ncondition. Applied to the cases at hand, that condition holds\nthat properly appreciating tragic drama (or other relevantly similar\nworks of art) involves forming a mental state with a negative\nvalence. In other words, to respond appropriately to a tragic\ndrama is, to undergo sadness, distress, anger, or some other emotion\nor feeling that is in itself unpleasant, undesirable, or\ndisvalued.",
            "Revisionary approaches reject that characterization of the state we\nare in as audiences for such painful art. They allow that a proper\nappreciation of the works in question elicits negative emotions, but\ndeny that those negative emotions must carry their characteristically\nunpleasant feeling or phenomenology. Such theories argue that the\ntypical valence of negative emotions is not present in the contexts in\nwhich we take pleasure in painful art, but the negative emotions\nremain.",
            "Describing such a theory, De Clercq (2014) notes",
            "According to one type of solution to the paradox, no emotion is in\nitself agreeable or disagreeable to experience. So-called negative\nemotions may be typically disagreeable, but they need not have a\nnegative “hedonic charge” (Morreall 1985; Walton 1990;\nGaut 1993; Neill 1992). (De Clercq 2014: 112)",
            "If it is not a disagreeable feeling, what then explains the\nattribution of a “negative” aspect to those emotions\nelicited by tragic drama? Revisionist theories say the negative aspect\nbelongs not to the phenomenology of undergoing the emotion, but to the\nevaluation of the situation that the emotion is about.",
            "Walton thus remarks",
            "Hume’s characterization of sorrow as a passion that is “in\nitself disagreeable” is very much open to question. What is\nclearly disagreeable are the things we are sorrowful about—the\nloss of an opportunity, the death of a friend—not the feeling or\nexperience of sorrow itself. (1990: 258).",
            "Thus, the sorrow one feels for a fictional character need not be in\nitself a disagreeable or negatively-valenced experience; it is\nundesirable by virtue of the undesirable situation that it registers\nan evaluation of (Neill 1992: 62). This approach treats the negativity\nof a negative emotion as, at least sometimes, a relational property of\nthe event or state of affairs the emotion is a response to. Only\nsecondarily, and only sometimes, does the disvalue of the state of\naffairs prompt an unpleasantness in the phenomenology of undergoing\nthe emotion elicited by awareness of that state of affairs.",
            "This distinction between the negativity of an emotion’s\ncharacteristic phenomenology and the negativity of the event or state\nof affairs the emotion is about may make sense only within an\nexcessively cognitive characterization of emotions. Yes, our sorrow\npresents its object—the death of a friend—as\ndisagreeable, as counting against one’s wellbeing, as a loss of\nvalue, etc. But it is at least prima facie true that sorrow\nitself is undesirable beyond its instantiation merely being an\nindication of an undesirable state of affairs. That is because the\nnegative valence of such emotions is the means by which they express,\nqua emotions, the undesirability of their objects. This is\nhow emotions contrast with beliefs—which lack a characteristic\nphenomenology—as distinct ways of representing the values of\nthings. Consider how bad being anxious feels, when anxiety is\nessentially about something that has not yet happened and hence has\nnot yet instantiated the harm or loss of value of what, if the event\ncomes about, may be an additional factor counting against one’s\nwellbeing. The badness of the feeling of being anxious is a feature of\nthe emotion because of the emotion’s function in putting us on\nguard against immanent harm. This is just as the badness of the\nfeeling caused by disgust is a feature of the emotion in its capacity\nas a warning signal, or reminder, of the danger of being exposed to\nharmful substances.",
            "Of course, different theories of emotions will differ in the extent to\nwhich they see the standard phenomenology of an emotion as an\nessential feature of it. If a theory, for example, includes within the\nscope of experiences of fear, those in which the typical\nunpleasantness of feeling fear is absent, then revisionist approaches\nare on firm ground in claiming that such negative emotions need not\nhave a negative hedonic charge. But the prima facie challenge\nto such revisionism is to question why its opponents should admit into\nthe extension of an emotion concept any putative cases of\nsuch responses shorn of their typical feelings.",
            "If the revisionist view here was presented in the strongest terms,\nwhere the only negativity of a negative emotion belongs to\nthe state of affairs the emotion is about, this would entail the\nimplausible conclusion that there is no point in engaging in the\ncommon practice of trying to manage one’s sadness or distress\nabout some sad or distressing state of affairs. Unless one’s\ngoal is to convince oneself that the situation was\nmisinterpreted as sad or distressing, trying to manage\none’s feelings about it would be inconsistent with recognizing\nits truth. However, a significant challenge threatens even a more\nmoderate version of the revisionist proposal—one that allows\nthat the feeling of merely undergoing a negative emotion can be among\nthe sources of its negativity. The challenge is to explain why the\nnegative emotions elicited by tragic dramas are exceptions to emotions\nof their kind in not causing unpleasantness or distress, or in causing\njust pleasure. The revisionist theory cannot help itself to the\nvarious proposals that the context of fictions—e.g., our\ndistance from the represented events—ameliorates the pain of\nwitnessing distressing events. For then the revisionist theory\ncollapses into one of those theories and its denial that the\ndispleasing emotions we feel for tragedy possess a negative valence\nbecomes unmotivated.",
            "An alternative revisionary approach suggests that the emotions we feel\nin fictional contexts ought not to be assimilated to emotions we feel\nin real life contexts because the former are a particular kind of\nemotion associated with pretense and imagining:\n“quasi-emotions” in the nomenclature that Walton employs\nin his theory of fiction (1978 and 1990). The thought here is that\nimagining or pretending to have an experience of x does not\nrequire imagining or pretending to experience all of the properties\nconstitutive of x. Imagining that I’m flying does not\nrequire me to imagine experiencing the feeling of flying (even though\nit might involve visually imagining my flying or imagining believing\nthat I’m flying). So imagining feeling sad over the death of\nCordelia need not require my response to exhibit all the properties it\nwould if I were really sad, such as sadness’s valence and\ncharacteristic motivational dimensions. The solution here is to deny\nthat our experience of such art is genuinely painful, a cause of\nsuffering, a source of sadness, disgust, fear, and so on, in whole or\npart. Instead, what appear to be such negatively-valenced emotions are\nin fact only imagined or pretend affective responses. These responses\nshare certain characteristics with those of emotions we feel in\nnon-fictional contexts, just not their unpleasantness. If this is\ntrue, then there is no conflict between the coordination\ncondition that says we don’t take pleasure in painful\nexperiences and the response condition that affirms that we\ntake pleasure in the experience of aversive art. For our experience of\nsuch art on this understanding does not involve pain, but involves\nrather an affective state that only resembles pain while not being an\ninstance of the kind of emotion that we may feel for genuinely tragic\nstates of affairs that we know to be actual.",
            "Whether the emotions we feel for the contents of fictions are\ncontinuous with those we have for what is represented by our beliefs\nand other truth-apt attitudes is a substantial question addressed in\ndiscussions of the so-called paradox of fictions. Reasons to doubt\nthat such emotions felt for the objects of imaginings are of the same\nkind as “real world” emotions, include: asymmetries in\ntheir phenomenology, differences in their functional roles, the\ncognitive or evaluative content of each affective state, and the\ndirect-objects of each state (Gilmore 2013; Stecker 2011).",
            "Whatever the resolution is of that debate, it should be noticed that,\neven if such emotions are identified as only\n“quasi”—as within a pretense or imagining, not\noutside and directed in—this does not entail that they are\nsomehow less painful or disagreeable.",
            "For it is plausibly the case that in order to experientially\nimagine feeling sad over the death of a fictional character,\none has to experience the most central, or even constitutive, aspect\nof sadness—its negative valence. Without that, why say one is\n(experientially) imagining feeling sad, rather than merely imagining\nthat one occupies the perceptual and other dimensions that accompany\nfeeling sad, without feeling sad? Also, it might be suggested that,\naside from the negative evaluations they represent of their targets,\nwhat fiction-directed sadness and ordinary sadness have in common such\nthat we treat them as intimately related is that they feel\nbad. In other words, any plausible interpretation of the role of\nquasi-emotions in our engagements with fictions must allow the\npossibility that they carry with them similar bodily, affective, and\nother phenomenological dimensions as their counterpart ordinary\nemotions. They may, as in one interpretation, lack the dimension of\nbelief, or commitment to a proposition, about their object being real,\nand lack any motivation or reason for action (as one can’t\nintervene in a fictional world) but their being identified as\nquasi-emotions of particular type may depend upon their having a\nsimilar phenomenology to the real-world-directed prototypes. So even\nallowing that it is a quasi-emotion that we experience when we engage\nwith aversive art forms (quasi-disgust, quasi-horror, quasi-sadness)\nwe still need to explain how our pleasure in undergoing such feelings\nis consistent with our tendency (per the coordination\ncondition) not to take pleasure in, and to avoid where possible,\nexperiences with negative valences (Friend 2007). Whether the emotions\nwe have for tragic dramas are real or pretend, they carry feelings of\npain and distress; why we choose to engage in an activity that causes\nthose feelings—perhaps even for the realization of those\nfeelings—remains a puzzle."
